Git status checks your working tree to see if its dirty or clean
dirty = unstaged modifications / clean = staged and ready for commit
    git status

Git Stage and Add are both similar as they both prepare your changes for commit
    git stage .
    git add .

Git commit is done once your work is ready to be pushed
using the flag -m makes it so that you can add a commit message keep it useful i.e what you have done since last commit
    git commit -m "Commit message here"

git push finally pushes your work upto github    
    git push origin feature1

(To make life a little easier you can set upstream so all you have todo is git pull or git push)
    git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/feature1

git pull origin feature1
